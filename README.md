# Gusty

Gusty is a tool to enable some personal 'Quantified Self' experiments. It will extract time-series data from Twitter feeds and generate metrics as charts & aggregate stats.

Gusty will use predefined hashtags & tweet patterns to categorise data.

It is envisaged that this is just one of a number of data sources. Some data will be extracted from consumer and home made sensor equipment.
